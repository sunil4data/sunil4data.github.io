Its associated Shiny web app is available at https://sunil4data.shinyapps.io/data_science_capstone/. NOTE that this solution was created using probabilistic and definitive language modeling algorithms, i.e., not using neural networks such as RNN/GRU/LSTM/etc.

My later Kaggle NLP competition solutions use newer ML alternatives namely Pre-trained or own trained Word Embeddings, RNN, LSTM, Attention, etc.
