    "This kernel can be used to submit to Cats & Dogs Kaggle competition. One can try 1st option for training just the last layer, i,e., Dense FC layer while re-using pretrained ResNet* layers. Other option is to try SGDR. Then another approach given below is to try SGDR with Differential Learning Rate. Observe the validation loss, validation accuracy and Kaggle score. NOTE that try this with GPU ON and Internet CONNECTED in your Kaggle kernel. One can try fast.ai Images Augmentation while preparing the ConvNet model before model learning and it is one of the ways of better generalizing our deep learning - refer to https://becominghuman.ai/data-augmentation-using-fastai-aefa88ca03f1 .\n",

    "Even before moving to lectures beyond Lesson #1, I got curious to explore learning performance with various options given in fast.ai Lesson #1 notebook and explored if all fast.ai tricks can be implemented in Keras & TensorFlow.

    "    * Refer to the below plot of learning schedule for cycle_len=1 (notice iteration count as ~313, i.e., 10k/32)\n",
    "    * It is based on the concept of Cyclical Learning, a.k.a., Learning Rate Annealing with Warm Restart. SGD with Learning Rate Annealing schedule is a common practice to compete with adaptive Adam optimizer.\n",
    "    * Learning Rate decays as per half cosine with each Epoch Step (ref model.py >> step fn) and it restarts with specified Learning Rate value\n",
    "*  Differential Learning Rate for Fine Tuning PreTrained ResNet*    \n",
    "    * It is not enough to just train and re-train the Dense FC last layer while keeping ResNet layers frozen.\n",
    "    * We idenity best Learning Rate for Dense FC last layer and apply sclaed down Learning Rate for ResNet* grouped layers (Fast.ai seem to have treated ResNet* in 2 grouped layers & I'm yet to figure out as how this grouping has been done).\n",
